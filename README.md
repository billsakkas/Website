- Responsive slideshow for the pages displayed inside.
- Redesign of the menu bar on the left that will only uses images instead of text.
- A robot/crawler much like [Google crawlers](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1061943?hl=en) to scan the internet for sites of interest to display on the page.
- An algorithm that learns from the user and displays what the user will most likely prefer.
